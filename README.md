# 3D Galaxy Collision Simulator

A high-performance, custom-built 3D Galaxy Collision Simulator written in pure C++ (using the C++17 Standard Library only). This project simulates the gravitational interaction and collision of two stable galaxies (comprising stellar discs, bulges, and massive dark matter halos) using a highly optimized Barnes-Hut octree.

## Project Overview & Roadmap

This project is built incrementally following the roadmap:

- **Foundation & Spatial DB Integration** - Standardized particle representations, memory pooling, and importing stellar catalogs from spatial data sources. This was completed in another project first stored as **[Spatial_DB Repository](https://github.com/lakshya076/Spatial_DB)**. Currently instead of loading external data, mathematical models are used to generate two galaxies, the full generated data is stored in the Octree format (for CPU based rendering) to optimize Barnes-Hut later.
- **Initial Conditions Generator** - Mathematical generation of stable galaxies using
  - Miyamoto-Nagai stellar discs
  - Hernquist bulges
  - Dark Matter Halos
- **Barnes-Hut Gravity Approximation and Leapfrog Integration** - Bottom-up mass aggregation and fast gravitational force calculation using the $\theta = \frac{s}{d}$ approximation. Then the temporal integrator calculates the updated velocities and positions of each star over time steps ($\Delta t$).
- **Live OpenGL Graphics Pipeline** - Real-time visualization using GLFW/GLEW with a free-flying WASD camera. The `PlaybackStar` memory layout streams directly into OpenGL Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) with zero overhead.
- **Offline Physics Baking** - Decoupling the engine into a background Physics Baker (dumps binary data to SSD) and a GPU Playback Viewer for an adjustable FPS viewing of extremely heavy simulations.
- **GPU/CUDA Optimization** - CPU based simulation cost around 2 seconds per frame generation. CUDA optimizations were made to run the heavy compute directly onto the GPU to reduce this time to ~0.4 seconds per frame generation.

## 🛠️ Architecture & Constraints

Current the project runs in three modes:
#### 1. Live Mode - Runs the simulation and visualizes it in real-time.
#### 2. Bake Mode - Runs the simulation and bakes it to a binary file (simulation.bin).
#### 3. Playback Mode - Reads the baked binary file and visualizes it.

To achieve real-time simulation performance, the engine adheres to strict hardware-friendly memory layouts and caching constraints:

### 1. The Memory Pool (`ArenaAllocator`)
Instead of standard dynamic allocations (`new`/`delete`) which cause memory fragmentation and latency, the simulator relies on a custom `ArenaAllocator`. It provisions contiguous blocks of RAM instantly. The arena is completely wiped (pointer reset to 0) and rebuilt every single frame.

### 2. High-Density Cache-Line Octree (`OctreeNode`)
`OctreeNode` structs are strictly packed and aligned to exactly 32 bytes (`alignas(32)`). This guarantees that reading a node loads exactly half of an L1 cache-line, preventing cache misses and doubling cache density. 
* The bounds are mathematically simplified using a `center` coordinate and `half_width` instead of standard min/max bounding boxes.
* To maintain this 32-byte limit, **no physics data (like mass or center of mass) is stored inside the node struct itself**. 

### 3. The Indirection Array
Instead of limiting leaf nodes to a small array of stars, the engine uses a global Indirection Array. Leaf nodes store a 32-bit `start_star_index`, allowing them to hold up to 32 stars without increasing the node struct size. This keeps the octree incredibly shallow, eliminating pointer-chasing latency.

### 4. Star Struct (Array of Structures)
All stellar particles (visible disc stars, bulge stars, and dark matter macro-particles) are stored in a unified flat array:
```cpp
struct Star {
    float x, y, z;    // 3D position
    float vx, vy, vz; // 3D velocity
    float mass;       // Particle mass
    bool is_dm;       // Dark matter flag (is_dm = true skips rendering)
};
```

### 5. Node Physics (Structure of Arrays)
Because the `OctreeNode` cannot exceed 32 bytes, all node-level physics data (such as total mass and 3D Center of Mass) is stored in parallel arrays (`float* node_masses`, etc.) and accessed using the node's index.

### 6. Memory Locality & Prefetching
* **Morton Z-Order Curve Sorting:** The `stars` array is parallel-sorted using GCC's `__gnu_parallel::sort` according to a 64-bit interleaved Morton Code before tree construction. This ensures OpenMP threads process physically adjacent subsets of the tree, maximizing spatial locality.
* **Manual L1 Memory Prefetching:** The hottest direct-gravity math loop utilizes compiler intrinsics (`__builtin_prefetch`) to actively pull the *next* star's data into the L1 cache while the FPU computes the inverse square root math for the *current* star.

### 7. GPU CUDA Architecture
* **Karras 2012 Binary Radix Tree:** The CPU Octree builder was entirely eliminated because CPU-GPU memory copies (`cudaMemcpy`) became the ultimate bottleneck. The GPU now builds its own tree every frame using the Karras 2012 algorithm. This assigns 64-bit Morton codes to all particles, sorts them via `cub::DeviceRadixSort`, and constructs a Binary Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) purely through fast bitwise longest-common-prefix searches.
* **Split BVH Structs (AoS to SoA):** The BVH tree nodes are split into two parallel arrays: `BvhNodeBuild` (containing bounding boxes used during aggregation) and `BvhNodeTraverse` (containing only mass, center of mass, and child indices). This 32-byte cache-aligned structure prevents cache thrashing during traversal.
* **Hardware Read-Only Cache (`__ldg`):** The gravity kernel traverses the BVH tree using `__ldg((float4*)node)` intrinsics, which forces the GPU to route memory fetches through the Read-Only Texture Cache. Since the BVH topology does not change during the gravity step, this massively accelerates memory bandwidth.
* **Active Node Masking (Legacy):** In earlier revisions, the CPU octree populated an 8-bit `active_mask` to prevent the GPU from evaluating empty spatial octants. With the transition to the 100% GPU-resident Binary BVH, empty space is mathematically eliminated by the Radix Tree structure itself, rendering the mask obsolete.
* **Zero-Copy VBO Interop & Live Mode:** In Live mode, CUDA registers and maps the OpenGL Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) directly. The calculated physics positions are written straight into the graphics memory buffer without hitting the PCIe bus (`cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost` is entirely bypassed). In addition, all CPU bounding box calculations and Morton sorting are bypassed, leaving the CPU completely idle during Live rendering.

### 8. Physics Integration & Stability
* **Semi-Implicit Euler (Leapfrog) Integration:** The engine uses Leapfrog integration which preserves orbital energy significantly better than standard explicit Euler integration.
* **Dark Matter Gravity Softening:** Dark Matter is simulated as massive diffuse gas halos using a large softening length parameter (`epsilon_sq = 10.0f`). This physically caps the maximum gravity experienced by passing stars, preventing catastrophic orbital ejections while maintaining extreme 100% timescale collisions.

### 9. Visual Rendering
* **Velocity-Based Color Mapping:** The collision assigns distinct Fire (Red/Yellow) and Ice (Blue/Cyan) color palettes to the two galaxies based on orbital velocity and core temperature.
* **Faint Halo Rendering:** Dark Matter macro-particles are flagged on the GPU as `type = 1` and rendered natively as a faint purple mist using OpenGL alpha blending and discard shaders.

## 🧪 Mathematical Formulations (Initial Conditions)

The initial galaxies are generated using the following astronomical density profiles:
* **Miyamoto-Nagai Disc:** Used to spawn visible stars in a flattened stellar disk with circular orbital velocities.
* **Hernquist Bulge:** Generates a tightly packed galactic core with random velocity dispersions.
* **Hernquist Dark Matter Halo:** Spawns massive, diffuse dark matter macro-particles (`is_dm = true`) to act as the gravitational glue stabilizing the galaxies.
* **Collision Setup:** The generator constructs two identical stable galaxies, applies a spatial offset (e.g., $\pm 500$ units on the X-axis), adds opposing translational velocity vectors to set them on a collision course, and merges them into the flat `stars` array.

## ⏱️ Performance Benchmarks

Simulating the gravitational physics for **300,000 particles** using the $O(N \log N)$ Barnes-Hut algorithm is extremely heavy. The system was engineered across several major revisions to maximize framerates. 

Here is the evolution of the per-frame generation time (lower is better):

| Implementation Phase | Frame Gen Time | Effective FPS | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Baseline CPU (Single Threaded)** | ~39.96 s | ~0.025 FPS | Initial Conditions.|
| **2. Baseline CPU (OpenMP)** | ~2.00 s | ~0.5 FPS | Achieved parallelization using OpenMP.|
| **3. Initial CUDA GPU Port** | ~0.45 s | ~2.2 FPS | Naive GPU physics computation using standard data layouts. |
| **4. Hybrid GPU Physics + CPU Octree** | ~0.30 s | ~3.3 FPS | Pre-computed Morton Sorting on CPU and used SoA VRAM layouts. Bottlenecked heavily by CPU tree building (`0.22s`) and `cudaMemcpy` overhead. |
| **5. Fully GPU-Resident (Bake Mode)** | ~0.031 s | ~31.4 FPS | The CPU is completely bypassed. The GPU sorts, builds a Karras Binary BVH, aggregates mass, and solves gravity all in VRAM. Tree building takes `< 3.2ms`. The gravity traversal is accelerated using `__ldg` through the hardware texture cache. |
| **6. Fully GPU-Resident (Live Mode)** | ~0.065 s | ~20 FPS | **Current State.** Exactly the same physics performance as Bake mode, plus the overhead of rendering 300,000 points dynamically via OpenGL. PCIe transfers (`cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost`) and CPU processing are completely eliminated using VBO mapping. |
| **7. Playback Mode (Zero-Physics)** | - | **Adjustable FPS** | Bypasses all physics and streams the baked `simulation.bin` directly into the GPU's VRAM. Limited only by disk read speed and monitor refresh rate. |

### Compiling and Running

This simulator is split into three decoupled execution modes, allowing you to bake incredibly heavy physics offline and play them back later in real-time. You can compile either the GPU-accelerated version (utilizing CUDA) or the CPU-only version (utilizing OpenMP).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Customizing Paths for Your Machine:**
> You **must** adjust the folder paths in the compilation commands below to match your local installation:
> 1. `-ccbin "D:\VisualStudio\VC\Tools\MSVC\..."`: Point this to the absolute directory containing your local MSVC host compiler `cl.exe`.
> 2. `-I"C:\msys64\mingw64\include"` and library paths (`"C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\libglfw3.dll.a"` / `"C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\libglew32.dll.a"`): Point these to your local MinGW or header/library folder where GLFW, GLEW, and GLM are installed.
> 3. `-arch=sm_86`: Adjust to target your GPU's actual Compute Capability architecture (e.g., `sm_86` for Ampere/RTX 30xx, `sm_89` for Ada Lovelace/RTX 40xx, `sm_75` for Turing/RTX 20xx).

#### 1. Live Mode (Normal Simulation & Render)
Runs the physics engine and immediately renders each frame. Best for real-time visualization of moderate to large particle counts.
* **GPU CUDA Build (Recommended):**
  ```bash
  nvcc -std=c++17 -O3 -arch=sm_86 -ccbin "D:\VisualStudio\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.50.35717\bin\Hostx64\x64" -Xcompiler "/openmp /fp:fast /arch:AVX2 /Zc:preprocessor" .\main.cpp .\generator.cpp .\engine.cpp .\gravity_aggregator.cpp .\renderer.cpp .\cuda_engine.cu -o main.exe -I"C:\msys64\mingw64\include" "C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\libglfw3.dll.a" "C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\libglew32.dll.a" -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -luser32 -lshell32
  $env:PATH += ";C:\msys64\mingw64\bin"; .\main.exe
  ```
  *(Pass the `--cpu` argument at runtime to bypass the GPU and run on OpenMP CPU fallback.)*
* **CPU-Only GCC Build:**
  ```bash
  g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -fopenmp -ffast-math -march=native .\main.cpp .\generator.cpp .\engine.cpp .\gravity_aggregator.cpp .\renderer.cpp -o main_cpu.exe -I"C:\msys64\mingw64\include" -L"C:\msys64\mingw64\lib" -lglfw3 -lglew32 -lopengl32 -lgdi32
  $env:PATH += ";C:\msys64\mingw64\bin"; .\main_cpu.exe
  ```

#### 2. Bake Mode (Offline Physics Baker)
Calculates physics as fast as possible in the terminal (window rendering is disabled) and dumps the visible stars to `simulation.bin` using the compact 16-byte `PlaybackStar` format. For a 1000 frame bake, this file reaches around **3.2 GB** in size (down from the uncompressed **9.2 GB** thanks to dark matter filtering and attribute stripping).
* **GPU CUDA Build (Recommended):**
  ```bash
  nvcc -std=c++17 -O3 -arch=sm_86 -DMODE_BAKE -ccbin "D:\VisualStudio\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.50.35717\bin\Hostx64\x64" -Xcompiler "/openmp /fp:fast /arch:AVX2 /Zc:preprocessor" .\main.cpp .\generator.cpp .\engine.cpp .\gravity_aggregator.cpp .\renderer.cpp .\cuda_engine.cu -o bake.exe -I"C:\msys64\mingw64\include" "C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\libglfw3.dll.a" "C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\libglew32.dll.a" -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -luser32 -lshell32
  $env:Path += ";C:\msys64\mingw64\bin"; .\bake.exe <num_frames>
  ```
  *(Pass `--cpu` as the second argument, e.g. `.\bake.exe 1000 --cpu`, to bake using the CPU engine.)*
* **CPU-Only GCC Build:**
  ```bash
  g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -fopenmp -ffast-math -march=native -DMODE_BAKE .\main.cpp .\generator.cpp .\engine.cpp .\gravity_aggregator.cpp .\renderer.cpp -o bake_cpu.exe -I"C:\msys64\mingw64\include" -L"C:\msys64\mingw64\lib" -lglfw3 -lglew32 -lopengl32 -lgdi32
  $env:Path += ";C:\msys64\mingw64\bin"; .\bake_cpu.exe <num_frames>
  ```

#### 3. Playback Mode (Zero-Physics Viewer)
Disables the physics engine entirely. Initializes OpenGL and rapidly streams the pre-baked frames from `simulation.bin` directly into the VRAM at adjustable FPS.
* **GPU CUDA Build (Recommended):**
  ```bash
  nvcc -std=c++17 -O3 -arch=sm_86 -DMODE_PLAYBACK -ccbin "D:\VisualStudio\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.50.35717\bin\Hostx64\x64" -Xcompiler "/openmp /fp:fast /arch:AVX2 /Zc:preprocessor" .\main.cpp .\generator.cpp .\engine.cpp .\gravity_aggregator.cpp .\renderer.cpp .\cuda_engine.cu -o play.exe -I"C:\msys64\mingw64\include" "C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\libglfw3.dll.a" "C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\libglew32.dll.a" -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -luser32 -lshell32
  $env:PATH += ";C:\msys64\mingw64\bin"; .\play.exe
  ```
  * **CPU-Only GCC Build:**
  ```bash
  g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -fopenmp -ffast-math -march=native -DMODE_PLAYBACK .\main.cpp .\generator.cpp .\engine.cpp .\gravity_aggregator.cpp .\renderer.cpp -o play_cpu.exe -I"C:\msys64\mingw64\include" -L"C:\msys64\mingw64\lib" -lglfw3 -lglew32 -lopengl32 -lgdi32
  $env:PATH += ";C:\msys64\mingw64\bin"; .\play_cpu.exe
  ```
